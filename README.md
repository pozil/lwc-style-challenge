# LWC Style Challenge

Join us for a friendly **LWC Style Challenge**!

Tweet screenshots of your coolest style customization of this mock app with the **`#LWCStyleChallenge`** hashtag. Weâ€™ll review submissions and elect the best work.

There's only one simple rule: you may modify `styleChallengeHome.css`. No HTML or JS changes!
